# Sleep Diary :sleeping:  :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The project which I based my thesis on during the last semester of my Frontend education.

So it's basically a timer which I can use to track the amount of time I've slept each night. Each session (representing a night's sleep) is stored in the browser's local storage. That way I've them at hand when I need to iterate over them - like when I list information about the sessions and calculate the total sum of the sleep time, as a way to help me survey my sleep habits.

Made with help of the **React** framework.

**Disclaimer:**
> Due to time constraints and the nature of the course (where a lot of focus was on documentation and report writing) and inexperience working with React (at the time) the app is pretty lackluster as it is. My initial vision was to add more features - but a working (mobile first) foundation is there!
